Proposed Title
==============
Web Components are the Revolution

Summary
=======
Web Components are about to change everything you think you know about building websites. You get how CSS works, right? wrong! HTML? nope. JavaScript? nawww.

Web Components are an umbrella which encompass many different new specs: Templates, HTML Imports, Custom Elements, Decorators and Shadow DOM. They will force us to rethink almost every aspect of web design, from CSS scoping and markup conventions to JavaScript design patterns.

I'll take you step by step as we delve into this new dark art and together we'll build something which can only be described as straight up black magic. We'll also peek at some of the cool new toys (shiny!) and frameworks which use this technology. If you're curious about what your job will look like in the next few years, or if you just want to watch a room full of people have their minds blown out, come see the future that Web Components will bring.

Previous Speaking
=================
Part of my role at GE has been to educate teams on new front-end technologies. This includes speaking and screencasting. Here's a video of a RequireJS talk I re-shot for my blog.

I'll also be speaking at Women Who Code in August on the subject of becoming a self-taught developer.
